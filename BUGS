			BUGS AND REMARKS

Kutill Mc Kee algorithm to numerate degrees of freedom is not
completely correct and should be corrected.  Bad accuracy of loads in
Newton-Cotes integration formulaes for hight degrees.

getfem_slices have some missing triangles with complex slices.

Hermite element is still not working.

P0 element should not be used with fem_sum (pb wrt 'all_faces' and dirichlet condition).
