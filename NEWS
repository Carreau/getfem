What's new ?
2004/01/23 Getfem++ 1.6 and Gmm++ 1.6 released

Getfem++ 1.6 is mostly a bugfix and performance improvements release.

    * Some new integration methods were added (high order methods for triangles such as "IM_TRIANGLE(19)" from P. Solin, K. Segeth and I. Dolezel: "Higher-Order & Finite Element Methods", Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, 2003).
    * Performance of interpolation and geometric transformation inversion was much improved.
    * Support for emc2 meshes

The Gmm++ library has been much improved version 1.6 and version 1.5. We have especially focused on its robustness.

    * Many bugs were fixed, especially for complex matrices.
    * QR algorithms were introduced for dense matrices.
    * A LAPACK/ATLAS interface is available.
    * SuperLU 2.0 interface.
    * Small simplification in linalg_traits structure.
    * Generic resize procedures for vector and matrices were introduced.
    * It is possible to use a column or row matrix view of a vector with gmm::row_vector and gmm::col_vector.
    * Generic gmm::reshape and gmm::conjugated functions.
    * Intensive tests with random type of matrices and vectors.

2003/07/25 Getfem++ 1.5 and Gmm++ 1.5 released
First standalone release of Gmm++, which now includes some preconditioners and harwell-boeing/matrix-market data file support. It is now possible to use high precision computations of elementary integrals with the (optional) QD library. Quadrature data has been moved into data files in the cubature/ directory. Initial support for XFem. Mesh slices in getfem++ and getfem-matlab. The Matlab interface was merged into a single giant mex-file.
2003/03/03 Getfem++ 1.4 released
The Matlab interface is now fully working and documented. Huge speed improvement on elementary computations. New generic assembly procedures. Introduction of Gmm++.
2002/09/24 Getfem++ 1.3 released
Introduction of hierarchical and composite FEMs and integration methods.
2002/08/21 Getfem++ 1.2 released
Introduction of the Hermite element (not fully working). Support for non-tau-equivalent elements. Introduction of a consistent naming system for FEMs, geometric transformations and integration methods.
2002/07/18 Getfem++ 1.1 released
Many improvements.
2002/06/28 Getfem++ 1.0 released
First public release.
