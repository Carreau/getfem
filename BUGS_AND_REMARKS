			BUGS AND REMARKS

___________________________________________________________________________

g++ (3.0) has a bug concerning dynamic libraries. No object with a non
trivial constructor or destructor can be used.
___________________________________________________________________________

with cxx (dec compiler) the difficulty to build dynamic libraries is to be
sure that all the template implementations are linked.
___________________________________________________________________________

MTL and ITL don't support the -pedantic option from g++
___________________________________________________________________________

cxx need the following definition
#define __USE_STD_IOSTREAM
which is present in dal_std.h. This means that dal_std.h should be include
first in any application which uses GETFEM (or __USE_STD_IOSTREAM should be
defined before any standard include file)
