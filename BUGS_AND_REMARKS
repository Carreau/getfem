			BUGS AND REMARKS

___________________________________________________________________________

g++ has a bug concerning dynamic libraries. No object with a non
trivial constructor or destructor can be used.
___________________________________________________________________________

with cxx (dec compiler) the difficulty to build dynamic libraries is to be
sure that all the template implementations are linked.
___________________________________________________________________________

MTL and ITL don't support the -pedantic option from g++
___________________________________________________________________________

cxx need the following definition
#define __USE_STD_IOSTREAM
which is present in dal_std.h. This means that dal_std.h should be include
first in any application which uses GETFEM (or __USE_STD_IOSTREAM should be
defined before any standard include file)
___________________________________________________________________________

On SGI, problem with dynamic libraries 
the use of 
  -update_registry .libs/so_locations
doesn't work and should be repalce with
  -check_registry /usr/lib/so_locations 
(dans libtool)
