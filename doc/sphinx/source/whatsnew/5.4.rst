  What's New in |gf| 5.4
************************

The main contribution of this version is the extension of the language allowing macro definition and explicit differentiation.

Released version, 2020/06/01.

The main changes are:

   * A support for variables defined at integration points 

   * A full support for the automatic condensation of variables determined by local equations (for instance for plasticity) (Konstantinos Poulios contribution)

   * A fully working Octave interface. Many thanks to Abderrahmane Bendali for the first adaptation of this interface from Matlab's one.

   * The use of Python 3 instead of Python 2.7 by default

   * A support for HHO methods
   
   * A support for the the assembly of product of terms defined on two different domains (integration on the product of two domains with a kernel, for instance).
