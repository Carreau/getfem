  What's New in |gf| 4.2
****************************

The New brick system is now mature and several coumplig brick has been developped.
Released version, 2012/07/31.

The main changes are:

   * The license of Getfem has moved to LGPL 3 with GCC Runtime Exception
     allowing commercial codes to use Getfem.

   * Contact/friction bricks has been extented to non-matching meshes and
     to integral contact condition with different augmentations (Alart Curnier,
     De Saxce projection, augmented multiliers). A large sliding contact
     brick is in progress.

   * A complete tool to perform continuation of the solution to a model with
     respect to one of its parameter and to detect bifurcation has been
     developped.
   * Some additional model bricks : pointwise constraint brick (to prescribe a constraint on a point eventually inside an element), basic nonlinear brick (for instance, for semi-linear equations)

   * The experimental mesher of Getfem is now (partially) interfaced with
     python/scilab/matlab.
     
   * Some tools to verify the consistence (tangent term) of a brick or
     the whole model has been added.

   * Many bug fixes.
