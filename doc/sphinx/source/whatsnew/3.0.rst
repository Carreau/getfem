  What's New in GetFEM++ 3.0
******************************

Getfem++ 3.0 is now available !

Not so many changes, but some of them are incompatible with getfem 
2.0:

   Released, 2007/06/27:

   * The getfem and gmm header files have been moved into their
     respective subdirectories. So, as a consequence, the include
     directives have to be updated:

     * ``#include "gmm_xxx.h"`` should be replaced with
       ``#include "gmm/gmm_xxx.h"`` 

     * ``#include "getfem_xxx.h"`` should be replaced with
       ``#include "getfem/getfem_xxx.h"``

   * The getfem interface (python and matlab) is now included in the
     getfem tar.gz file, in the `interface` subdirectory. They can
     be enabled with the ``--enable-python`` or ``--enable-matlab``
     switch of the configure script.

   * Some `C1` composite elements have been added (triangles and
     quadrilaterals).

   * Levelset support has been improved.

The full list of changes is available in the `ChangeLog
<http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/getfem/trunk/getfem%2B%2B/ChangeLog?rev=2640&view=auto>`_.
