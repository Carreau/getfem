|gf| is an  open source finite element library based on a collaborative development hosted by the |gnaweb|_ site. If you intend to make some contributions, you can ask for membership of the project there. Contributions of all kinds are welcome: documentation, bug reports, constructive comments, changes suggestions, bug fix, new models, etc ...

Contributors are of course required to be careful that their changes do not affect the proper functioning of the library and that these changes follow a principle of backward compatibility.

See |linktask|_ for a list of task and discussions about |gf| development.

**IMPORTANT** : a contributor implicitely accepts that his/her contribution will be distributed under the LGPL licence of |gf|.
