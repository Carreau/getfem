Installation
============

For the parallel version of the interface, see also :ref:`ud-parallel`.

In a Debian/Ubuntu system
-------------------------

GetFEM++ packages are available in the official repositories of Debian
and Ubuntu distributions.

Information about the GetFEM++ versions available in different Debian
releases can be found e.g. at

https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/getfem++

and with respect to different Ubuntu releases at

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/getfem++

GetFEM++ including its python interface can be installed from a terminal
by executing ``aptitude update`` and ``aptitude install python-getfem++``.

In a general unix/linux based systems
-------------------------------------

Since we use standard |gnu| tools, the installation of the |py| |gf| is
somewhat standard.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

It requires the python developpement files (python.h etc.) to be available
(package `python-all-dev` in debian distribution), and also the numpy and scipy
packages to be installed (package `python-numpy` and `python-scipy` in debian distribution).
In case of troubles with a non-GNU compiler, gcc/g++ (>= 4.8) should be a
safe solution (package `build-essential` in debian distribution).

If you want mesh generation, it requires the package qhull installed on
your system (package `libqhull-dev` in debian distribution).

If you want to build binaries from svn to get the latest changes,
improvements, bugfixes, new bugs, etc. It requires an svn client,
automake, autoconf and libtool.

If you want to use MUMPS linear sparse solver instead of SUPERLU, you need to install the sequential version of MUMPS (or the parallel one if you intend to use the parallel version of |gf|).

Download sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two ways to get |gf|, either as a compressed package (stable
release) or via anonymous svn access (unstable releases).

The latest stable release of |gf| is getfem++-|version|\.tar.gz

* download package:

   wget http://getfem.org/stable/getfem++-|version|\.tar.gz

* unpack:

   tar xzf getfem++-|version|\.tar.gz

* and go to the root directory of getfem:
     
   cd getfem++-|version|

The latest unstable releases is:

* checkout over SVN protocol (TCP 3690)::

   svn co svn://svn.gna.org/svn/getfem/trunk getfem

* or checkout over HTTP protocol (TCP 80)::

   svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/getfem/trunk getfem

* go to the root directory of getfem::

   cd getfem/getfem++
 
* and run ``autogen.sh`` script::

   bash autogen.sh

Compilling
^^^^^^^^^^

Configure with::

  ./configure --enable-python=yes

If you want to use a specific **BLAS** library, you may have to supply the
necessary link flags and libs to the configure script, for example with::

  ./configure --enable-python=yes BLAS_LIBS="-L/usr/lib/sse2/atlas -lblas"

More specific instruccions can be found in the README\* files of the
distribution.

.. warning::

   * you should not use a different compiler than the one that was used
     for |gf|.
   * you should have built the |gf| static library (i.e. do not use
     ``./configure --disable-static`` when building |gf|).
   * On linux/x86_64 platforms, a mandatory option when building |gf| (and
     any static library linked to them) is the ``--with-pic`` option of
     their ``./configure`` script.

Then start the compilation with::

  make

and finally install with::

  make install
