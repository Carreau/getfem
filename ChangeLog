	* tests/laplacian.C: huge simplification of the sources..

	* removed obsolete getfem_norm.h

	* src/getfem_mesh_slice.C: fixed the problem (missing simplexes)
	with 'union' operation on slice. Moreover, the slice boundary
	flagging is now better than ever. Added a bounding_box member
	function in geometric_trans.

	* Getfem-1.6 released. The ChangeLog is started!
