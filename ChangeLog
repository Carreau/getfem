	* src/getfem_mesh_slice.[Ch] src/getfem_mesh_slicers.[Ch]: the
	mesh_slices have been splitted in two parts: 

	- the mesh_slicer object, which takes a mesh, simplexifies it and
	sends thes simplexes to a list of "slicer_action" objects

	- the stored_mesh_slice object, which contains all simplexes that
	have been constructed by the mesh_slicer. This recording of
	simplexes is done via the slicer_build_stored_mesh_slice (derived
	from slicer_action) class.

	src/getfem_export.h: interpolation to a set of sparse points can 
	now interpolate the gradient of a field.

	* src/getfem_export.h: removed some obsolete interpolation functions.

	* tests/elastostatic.C: simplification, copied from laplacian.C 
	(elastostatique -> elastostatic)

	* tests/laplacian.C: huge simplification of the sources..

	* removed obsolete getfem_norm.h

	* src/getfem_mesh_slice.C: fixed the problem (missing simplexes)
	with 'union' operation on slice. Moreover, the slice boundary
	flagging is now better than ever. Added a bounding_box member
	function in geometric_trans.

	* Getfem-1.6 released. The ChangeLog is started!
